# Using Form actions with HTTP requests

## Development notes:
  * Uses backend_using_form_actions folder to connect with node.js server.
  * Ensure navigating to corresponding backend folder and run npm install,
    npm start to start the backedn server, followed by npm run dev on the react
    project root.
  * Ensure changing of the ports package.json for the backend folders
    accordingly as we have maintained a single repo for multiple tasks.
